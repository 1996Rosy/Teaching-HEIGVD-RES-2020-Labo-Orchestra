# Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2020-Labo-Orchestra

## Admin

* **You can work in groups of 2 students**.
* It is up to you if you want to fork this repo, or if you prefer to work in a private repo. However, you have to **use exactly the same directory structure for the validation procedure to work**. 
* We expect that you will have more issues and questions than with other labs (because we have a left some questions open on purpose). Please ask your questions on Telegram / Teams, so that everyone in the class can benefit from the discussion.

## Objectives

This lab has 4 objectives:

* The first objective is to **design and implement a simple application protocol on top of UDP**. It will be very similar to the protocol presented during the lecture (where thermometers were publishing temperature events in a multicast group and where a station was listening for these events).

* The second objective is to get familiar with several tools from **the JavaScript ecosystem**. You will implement two simple **Node.js** applications. You will also have to search for and use a couple of **npm modules** (i.e. third-party libraries).

* The third objective is to continue practicing with **Docker**. You will have to create 2 Docker images (they will be very similar to the images presented in class). You will then have to run multiple containers based on these images.

* Last but not least, the fourth objective is to **work with a bit less upfront guidance**, as compared with previous labs. This time, we do not provide a complete webcast to get you started, because we want you to search for information (this is a very important skill that we will increasingly train). Don't worry, we have prepared a fairly detailed list of tasks that will put you on the right track. If you feel a bit overwhelmed at the beginning, make sure to read this document carefully and to find answers to the questions asked in the tables. You will see that the whole thing will become more and more approachable.


## Requirements

In this lab, you will **write 2 small NodeJS applications** and **package them in Docker images**:

* the first app, **Musician**, simulates someone who plays an instrument in an orchestra. When the app is started, it is assigned an instrument (piano, flute, etc.). As long as it is running, every second it will emit a sound (well... simulate the emission of a sound: we are talking about a communication protocol). Of course, the sound depends on the instrument.

* the second app, **Auditor**, simulates someone who listens to the orchestra. This application has two responsibilities. Firstly, it must listen to Musicians and keep track of **active** musicians. A musician is active if it has played a sound during the last 5 seconds. Secondly, it must make this information available to you. Concretely, this means that it should implement a very simple TCP-based protocol.

### Instruments and sounds

The following table gives you the mapping between instruments and sounds. Please **use exactly the same string values** in your code, so that validation procedures can work.

| Instrument | Sound         |
|------------|---------------|
| `piano`    | `ti-ta-ti`    |
| `trumpet`  | `pouet`       |
| `flute`    | `trulu`       |
| `violin`   | `gzi-gzi`     |
| `drum`     | `boum-boum`   |

### TCP-based protocol to be implemented by the Auditor application

* The auditor should include a TCP server and accept connection requests on port 2205.
* After accepting a connection request, the auditor must send a JSON payload containing the list of <u>active</u> musicians, with the following format (it can be a single line, without indentation):

```
[
  {
  	"uuid" : "aa7d8cb3-a15f-4f06-a0eb-b8feb6244a60",
  	"instrument" : "piano",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:20:50.731Z"
  },
  {
  	"uuid" : "06dbcbeb-c4c8-49ed-ac2a-cd8716cbf2d3",
  	"instrument" : "flute",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:39:03.211Z"
  }
]
```

### What you should be able to do at the end of the lab


You should be able to start an **Auditor** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d -p 2205:2205 res/auditor
```

You should be able to connect to your **Auditor** container over TCP and see that there is no active musician.

```
$ telnet IP_ADDRESS_THAT_DEPENDS_ON_YOUR_SETUP 2205
[]
```

You should then be able to start a first **Musician** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
```

After this, you should be able to verify two points. Firstly, if you connect to the TCP interface of your **Auditor** container, you should see that there is now one active musician (you should receive a JSON array with a single element). Secondly, you should be able to use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP datagrams generated by the **Musician** container.

You should then be able to kill the **Musician** container, wait 10 seconds and connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor** container. You should see that there is now no active musician (empty array).

You should then be able to start several **Musician** containers with the following commands:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician drum
```
When you connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor**, you should receive an array of musicians that corresponds to your commands. You should also use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP trafic in your system.


## Task 1: design the application architecture and protocols

| #  | Topic |
| --- | --- |
|Question | How can we represent the system in an **architecture diagram**, which gives information both about the Docker containers, the communication protocols and the commands? |
| | ![](digram.jpg) | 
|Question | Who is going to **send UDP datagrams** and **when**? |
| |  The one sending UDP diagram is musician.js, the musicians when they play music (every secs). The sound must reach the auditor. As it is a sound made to reach the auditor's ears we don't need no answer from the auditor. |
|Question | Who is going to **listen to UDP datagrams** and what should happen when a datagram is received? |
| | The one listening to the UDP diagrams is auditor.js, the auditor that will receive the datagram. He should do nothing to respond to the musicians but he should tell the client via TCP what is the instrument that is playing | 
|Question | What **payload** should we put in the UDP datagrams? |
| | The payload we should put in the UDP datagrams are the sounds of the instrument that is playing.| 
|Question | What **data structures** do we need in the UDP sender and receiver? When will we update these data structures? When will we query these data structures? | 
| | The data structure we can use for this is a map with JSON.
 | 

## Task 2: implement a "musician" Node.js application

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | --- |
|Question | In a JavaScript program, if we have an object, how can we **serialize it in JSON**? |
| |  We can serialize an object with JSON using the instruction `JSON.stringify(object)`|
|Question | What is **npm**?  | 
| |npm is the world's largest Software Registry. npm is also a software Package Manager for Node.js and Installer (source:w3schools.com) | 
|Question | What is the `npm install` command and what is the purpose of the `--save` flag?  | 
| | npm includes a CLI (Command Line Client) that can be used to download and install software or/and packages using command `npm install`. You use  `--save` so that the package is installed in your computer and is usable for any project.   | 
|Question | How can we use the `https://www.npmjs.com/` web site?  | 
| | We can use this site to search package and have access to documentation about htose packages|
|Question | In JavaScript, how can we **generate a UUID** compliant with RFC4122? |
| | We download the UUID packet using npm, and as the documentation states, we use the function uuidv4|
|Question | In Node.js, how can we execute a function on a **periodic** basis? |
| | We can execute a function on a periodic basis using the instruction `setInterval(this.update.bind(this), 500);`  |
|Question | In Node.js, how can we **emit UDP datagrams**? |
| | We can use the dgram packet along with a udp socket and send with the `send` method | 
|Question | In Node.js, how can we **access the command line arguments**? |
| | `node app.js arg1 arg2` |


## Task 3: package the "musician" app in a Docker image

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | --- |
|Question | How do we **define and build our own Docker image**?|
| |`docker build -t res/musician .` |
|Question | How can we use the `ENTRYPOINT` statement in our Dockerfile?  |
| | `ENTRYPOINT ["node", "/opt/app/musician.js"]` |
|Question | After building our Docker image, how do we use it to **run containers**?  |
| | `docker run -d res/musician <instrument_name>`, we can replace instrument_name by any other instrument available|
|Question | How do we get the list of all **running containers**?  |
| | `docker ps`  |
|Question | How do we **stop/kill** one running container?  |
| | `docker kill <container_name>` |
|Question | How can we check that our running containers are effectively sending UDP datagrams?  |
| | We can use wireshark to verify that, by doing a capture of docker0|


## Task 4: implement an "auditor" Node.js application

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | ---  |
|Question | With Node.js, how can we listen for UDP datagrams in a multicast group? |
| | `socket.bind(protocol.PROTOCOL_PORT, () => {console.log('Joining multicast group');socket.addMembership(protocol.PROTOCOL_MULTICAST_ADDRESS);});` |
|Question | How can we use the `Map` built-in object introduced in ECMAScript 6 to implement a **dictionary**?  |
| | We can use the map built in object so that each key of the map is the uuid of a musician and its value would be an object containing the instrument, the first sound emitted by the instrument and the last sound emitted by the instrument |
|Question | How can we use the `Moment.js` npm module to help us with **date manipulations** and formatting?  |
| | moment.js can be used to calculate the difference between two moments or dates using the `diff` method and we can also get the moment when a sound has been emitted with the `moment()` method. We can format the date to see it in our screen using `moment().toString`|
|Question | When and how do we **get rid of inactive players**?  |
| | We get rid of an inactive player when it has not emitted a sound for more than 5 seconds by deleting it of the map using the `delete` method from map |
|Question | How do I implement a **simple TCP server** in Node.js?  |
| | Using these lines, you can implement a simple server using Node.js :
`const TCP_Server = net.createServer();`
`TCP_Server.listen(protocol.PROTOCOL_PORT);`|


## Task 5: package the "auditor" app in a Docker image

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | --- |
|Question | How do we validate that the whole system works, once we have built our Docker image? |
| | We can build the images res/musician and res/auditor and then run 1 auditor and several musicians (2 for example with 2 different instruments). If you kill a container before 5 seconds it should still be displayed to us by the auditor when we request it using a TCP request after 5 seconds it should have disappeared. TYou can send tcp request using netcat: `nc localhost 2205`|


## Constraints

Please be careful to adhere to the specifications in this document, and in particular

* the Docker image names
* the names of instruments and their sounds
* the TCP PORT number

Also, we have prepared two directories, where you should place your two `Dockerfile` with their dependent files.

Have a look at the `validate.sh` script located in the top-level directory. This script automates part of the validation process for your implementation (it will gradually be expanded with additional operations and assertions). As soon as you start creating your Docker images (i.e. creating your Dockerfiles), you should try to run it.
